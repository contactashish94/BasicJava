In this package....

we can see that a PC is not a monitor... but has a Monitor...

there are 2 types of a composition in java...
1. IS-A
2. HAS-A

As per definition : Creating Objects within objects...

having a master object, in this example, "thePc"..is managing and looking after the execution of the whole program...

thePc object is using composition to achieve that... as opposed to inheritance.
