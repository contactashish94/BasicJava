In this package....

We can see that , if the members of the Player class is public ,
and we can see an outsider from the Main class is taking the control over and changing the values.

why ???? -> because the members of the Player class is public (Accessible) from any where..

if we/the programmer really needs to take the control on his code and don't want an outsider to change the behaviour of the code...

try to make every thing secured... use "private"... give access to only those fields that are required.


Example 2 :

In the Enhanced Player example, we can see that the programmer has full control over the code.. none from outside can actually access/change functionality the code directly.

they can only access the code/functionality which the programmer wants.
